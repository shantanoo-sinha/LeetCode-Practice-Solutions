33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int lo=0,hi=nums.length-1;
        // find the index of the smallest value using binary search.
        // Loop will terminate since mid < hi, and lo or hi will shrink by at least 1.
        // Proof by contradiction that mid < hi: if mid==hi, then lo==hi and loop would have been terminated.
        while(lo<hi){
            int mid=(lo+hi)/2;
            if(nums[mid]>nums[hi]) lo=mid+1;
            else hi=mid;
        }
        // lo==hi is the index of the smallest value and also the number of places rotated.
        int rot=lo;
        lo=0;hi=nums.length-1;
        // The usual binary search and accounting for rotation.
        while(lo<=hi){
            int mid=(lo+hi)/2;
            int realmid=(mid+rot)%nums.length;
            if(nums[realmid]==target)return realmid;
            if(nums[realmid]<target)lo=mid+1;
            else hi=mid-1;
        }
        return -1;
